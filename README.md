# BeeArena
### ⚠️ OLD ⚠️  
This project is very old and I forgot how to build it.  
I also forgot most of the information about it.  
The files are provided.  If you can figure it out, go crazy.  

## Description  
*September 19, 2023*  
BeeArena is a plugin for Minecraft Spigot servers that allows you to create an  
arena in which special hostile bees spawn.  
  
These bees can only be harmed by weapons with specific names (configurable),  
and drop special items when they die, a Bee Stinger and a Pristine Stinger,  
with a 40% and a 5% chance respectively.  
  
## Setup  
Put the Jar file in your plugins folder.  
Start your server.  
Create a region named `beehive` in the world named `world` (both of these are  
configurable) and Man Huntin' Bees will periodically spawn if there are any  
players within the region.  
I think that's it.  
  
## Motivation  
I was asked to make this for a quest on a server I played on for a while.  
It was near the end of the server's life so I'm not actually sure how many  
people ended up playing it other than me.  
  
## Requirements  
Server:  Spigot 1.20, other support unknown  
WorldEdit 7.2.14, other support unknown  
WorldGuard 7.0.9, other support unknown
